# Prims-Algorithm

This repository is to maintain a grade XII Computer Science Project done by Kiranbaskar Velmurugan and Akshay Dhansoia. The Project is to
show an implementation of Prim's Algorithm to solve a problem. The problem statement can be formulated as follows: 

**Given an undirected weighted graph, find the minimum spanning tree in that graph.**

### Prim's Algorithm 
  Prim's algorithm is an algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree in a given undirected weighted graph. It is a greedy algorithm,
  it chooses locally optimal solutions to give a globally optimal solution. For a more concise description read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm).
